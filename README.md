Implement the code from the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf), all the architecture and parameters are the same as paper, the only different thing is that I trained the model with only 100 classes, because 1000 classes might take too much time. 

The accuracy and loss are shown as below:
